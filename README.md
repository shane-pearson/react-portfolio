# Description
This is my react portfolio. I plan to continue to build on this portfolio in the future, so you may se it change overtime. 

## Installation
Building this site started with getting the proper structure down. I needed to figure out al the separate elements that I needed, and then I had to connect them together. From there I could begin adding to the pages and really building up the site. 

## Usage
I hope to build on this portfolio site so I have a good was to show others all the things I learned in this class. I would also like to use in professionally while I have interviews, and connect with others.  

## Credits
For this project I used a lot of video tutorials and also refereed back to the class material.
